# Alone

Alone is a 2d game that I created using the Pygame module.
```
Built with:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame 2.0.x
```

## What I learned

Although this game was made for fun, this was the first real project made with the Pygame module. I learned how to 
implement trigonometric function within my code to make different objects (in this case Sprites) to move within the
game. I also learned about Sprites itself, and how to create an animation using them. I got a better understanding
dealing with classes and object oriented programming.

## How to Download & play

Clone the repository, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the folder's terminal.
